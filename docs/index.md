## What is DSG-JIT?

Modern spatial intelligence systems are fractured:

- **SLAM** handles metric consistency  
- **Neural fields / Gaussians** handle appearance & dense geometry  
- **Scene graphs** handle semantic structure & relationships  
- **Optimizers** handle consistency, often as a separate non-differentiable backend  

**DSG-JIT unifies all of these into one system:**

> A JIT-compiled, differentiable engine that builds, optimizes, and reasons over a 3D world model in real time.

This repository provides:

- A **differentiable factor-graph core** (SE3 + Euclidean)
- A **SceneGraphWorld** layer for poses, places, rooms, voxels
- **Voxel grid with smoothness + observation factors**
- **Learnable parameters** (odom, voxel obs, factor weights)
- **JIT-compiled solvers** (JAX Gauss–Newton on manifolds)
- A full suite of **tests, experiments, and benchmarks**

This forms the foundation for a future **differentiable Dynamic Scene Graph world model.**

## High-Level Architecture

![DSG-JIT Architecture](img/dsg-jit-architecture.png)

DSG-JIT is organized into five conceptual layers:

### 1. Sensor Frontend  
Processes raw sensor data (RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU) into:
- Depth / point clouds
- Frame-to-frame motion
- Optional semantics

### 2. JIT-Compiled SLAM Backend  
A differentiable factor graph performing:

- Pose optimization on SE3 manifolds  
- Loop closure / chain constraints  
- Learnable factor-type weights  
- Fully JIT-compiled Gauss–Newton  

### 3. Neural Field Module *(future integration)*  
To support:

- NeRF / Gaussian splatting  
- Photometric residuals  
- Dense geometry for segmentation  

### 4. Dynamic 3D Scene Graph Layer  
SceneGraphWorld tracking:

- Poses, places, rooms, agents  
- Attachments and voxel embeddings  
- Geometry + semantics as a single structure  

### 5. Global Optimization & Reasoning  
Unified optimization across:

- Trajectories  
- Voxels  
- Scene graph structure  
- Learnable factors
